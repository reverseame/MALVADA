# Extended capemon (CAPE's monitor)
The hooks performed by CAPE when analyzing Windows samples are defined within the CAPE monitor (capemon).
We provide the `dll`s we used in our CAPE instance:
- `capemon.dll` For Windows 32 bits (MD5: 366cea0d289a1263626dfd6889e8563e)
- `capemon_x64.dll` For Windows 64 bits (MD5: 4b58936c573555e64b6c33cc28a163e7)
