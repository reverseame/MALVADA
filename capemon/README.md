# Extended capemon (CAPE's monitor)
The hooks performed by CAPE when analyzing Windows samples are defined within the CAPE monitor (capemon).
We provide the `dll`s we used in our CAPE instance:
- `capemon.dll` For Windows 32 bits (MD5: e11aad6fa2a8d5d055eaafe0fa5b584c)
- `capemon_x64.dll` For Windows 64 bits (MD5: 0a42c2771cd6bbc4e05c4c9b3170d620)
