# Extended capemon (CAPE's monitor)
The hooks performed by CAPE when analyzing Windows samples are defined within the CAPE monitor (capemon).
We provide the `dll`s we used in our CAPE instance:
- `capemon.dll` For Windows 32 bits (MD5: 26DA91B8C5DB488BAE08967C617142C9)
- `capemon_x64.dll` For Windows 64 bits (MD5: D45F91258161BDF101425BB55DA02D9B)
